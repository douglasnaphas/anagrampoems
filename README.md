# anagrampoems
Anagram Poems is a website that helps you compose poems where each line is an anagram of the same phrase, like a name.

The site is currently usable for making poems, but it's under active development. Documentation on how to use the site is limited, and big changes may happen to the layout and features. The site saves your poems and allows you to access them when you're logged in, but please back up any important poems by copying and pasting their text or taking screenshots.

The main site is available at https://anagrampoems.com.

A testing site is also up at https://anagrampoems.us.
